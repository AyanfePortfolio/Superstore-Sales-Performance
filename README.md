## 🔄 Analysis Workflow 
1. Data Preparation: The dataset was already clean, properly structured, and ready for analysis.

2. KPI Calculations (Pivot Tables)
   Pivot Tables were used to compute the following core metrics: Total Profit, Total Sales, Total Transactions, Total Quantity Sold and Total Number of States

*Additional analytical views created:*
  - Segment vs Profit
  - Region vs Total Sales & Total Profit
  - Region vs Total Quantity Sold
  - Category vs Total Sales & Total Profit
  - Months vs Total Sales & Total Profit Trend
  - Customer Names vs Total Sales
  - Region vs Total Profit

3. Visualizations (Pivot Charts)
   Pivot Charts were built to visually represent:
  - Regional performance
  - Category and segment profitability
  - Monthly sales and profit trends
  - Top Customer sales contribution

4. Dashboard Interactivity
   To enhance insight generation, the dashboard includes:
- Year Slicer

   *These slicers update all KPI visuals simultaneously for dynamic filtering.*


## 📊 Insights and Recommendations 
-  The monthly trend analysis shows clear seasonality, with sales and profit peaking significantly in the final quarter, particularly in November and December. This trend highlights the importance of holiday driven strategies.
-  Understanding segment profitability is crucial for resource allocation. While Consumer delivers the highest profit percentage, tailored strategies are needed to unlock further potential in the Corporate and Home Office segments.
-  The top 10 customers collectively account for over 5% of the total sales revenue, emphasizing the need for dedicated account management.
-  The West ($108K) remains the strongest region and should be maintained and strategically expanded, the East ($91K) shows solid profitability with room for margin improvement, the Central ($40K) requires urgent review of discounts and operational costs, and the South ($47K) offers growth potential by adopting strategies used in the West and East.
-  In the Category by Sales and Profit analysis, Technology ($836K sales, $145K profit) leads in revenue but requires tighter margin control, Office Supplies ($719K sales, $122K profit) shows strong and reliable profit performance, and Furniture ($742K sales, $18K profit) delivers high sales but critically low profitability, demanding urgent review of shipping and discount strategies.
